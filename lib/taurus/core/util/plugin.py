    A dummy EntryPoint substitute to be used with :func:`selectEntryPoints`

    a :class:`pkg_resources.EntryPoint` instance.

def selectEntryPoints(group=None, include=('.*',), exclude=()):
    """
    Selects and prioritizes entry points from an entry point group.

    The entry points are selected using their name.

    The selection is done by regex matching on the names: first the entry
    points whose name matches any of the patterns in `excluded` are discarded;
    then each pattern in `included` is used to select from the names of the
    remaining entry points (from highest to lowest priority).

    In this way, the entry points are selected in the order dictated by
    the `included` pattern list. If a pattern matches several names, these
    will be sorted alphabetically. If a name is matched by several patterns,
    it is only selected by the first pattern.

    For example, if there are the following registered entry point names:
    ['foo1', 'foo2', 'baz1', 'baz2', 'bar1', 'bar2']
    And we use `exclude=("foo2",)` and `include=("bar2", "b.*1", "f.*")` ,
    then the selection will be: ["bar2","bar1","baz1","foo1"]

    Note: apart from regex patterns (strings or compiled) the `include` list
    can also contain :class:`pkg_resources`EntryPoint`-like instances
    (more specifically, an object having `.name` and `.load()` members), in
    which case they are added directly to the selected list. If a member is
    something other than a pattern or an EntryPoint-like object, it will be
    wrapped in an :class:`EntryPointAlike` instance and also included in the
    selection.

    :param group: (str) entry point group name from which the entry points
                  are obtained.
    :param include: (`tuple`). The members of the tuple can either be
                    patterns (both in the form of strings or of
                    :class:`re.Pattern` objects), which will be matched against
                    registered names in group; or EntryPoint-like objects which
                    will be included as they are; or an arbitrary object which
                    will be wrapped as an EntryPoint-like object before being
                    included. Default is `(".*",)`, which matches all
                    registered names in group and the sort is purely
                    alphabetical.
    :param exclude: (`tuple`). Regexp patterns (either `str` or
                    :class:`re.Pattern` objects) matching names to be excluded.
                    Default is `()`, so no entry point is excluded.

    :return: (list of :class:`pkg_resources.EntryPoint`) the selected entry
             points.
