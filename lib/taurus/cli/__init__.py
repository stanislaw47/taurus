"""
This module provides the taurus Command Line Interface

It is based on the click module to provide CLI utilities.

It defines a `taurus` command which can accept subcommands defined in
other taurus submodules or even in plugins.

To define a subcommand for taurus, you need to register it using the
`taurus_subcommands` entry point via setuptools.

.. todo:: add click link , add code snippet for plugins, etc.

This module provides also common options/flags for command-line interfaces
that can be used by taurus plugins. For list of available options,
see :mod:`taurus.cli.common`
